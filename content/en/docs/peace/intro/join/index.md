This will grant you access to Peace DAO's communications channels. You can participate in discussions, receive important announcements, and follow along in the DAO's governance process.

## Voting

Peace DAO is governed by its community. To vote, visit the `#üì©‚îÇvoting` channel and read over recent messages. If there is an ongoing vote, you can vote by selecting options beneath the voting message:

## Creating Proposals

To begin, read recent messages in the `#‚úç‚îÇproposals` channel. If you have a proposal idea, share it in that channel‚Äîeither as a formal proposal or as an informal message. DAO members will help you to refine your proposal and prepare it for voting.
