# Definition

Treasuries are the combination of assets, either digital or physical, that are held, managed, and shared collectively by groups of people in distributed organizations, such as DAOs.

# Details

Treasuries in digitally-native organizations usually take the form of multi-signature wallets. However, the place where the assets are stored is technically irrelevant and could be in a bank account or some other account or ledger.

Generally, treasuries are managed or directed by a group of people that own governance tokens that represent an amount of decision-making authority over a treasury’s assets.

Treasuries are the backbone of distributed organizations and groups of people who want to share assets, such as DAOs, digital co-ops, or collectives. Treasuries that have assets stored on cryptographic wallets have the ability to interface with Web3 tools & DeFi.

# Treasury Systems

## Definition

Treasury systems are software systems that help to enhance or provide additional functionality to digital wallets (e.g., multi-sigs) in the management of a treasury.

## Features

Treasury systems help people better manage how their treasuries are funded and how funds and governance are distributed. They can also help provide greater trust because rules can be enforced by smart contracts, protecting stakeholders from scams or rug pulls.

Treasury systems are still a new and emerging concept, pioneered by the [Juicebox Protocol](https://info.juicebox.money/dev/learn/overview). The general features that make up a treasury system include:

* Control conditions surrounding treasury inflows and outflows
* Set rules or conditions on how the treasury operates, enforced by smart contracts
* Automated minting of tokens, such as governance tokens, based on a defined set of rules

# Use-Cases

Treasuries and treasury systems have been used to power:

* Decentralized grant giving entities & investment clubs
* One-time or recurring fundraisers (e.g., non-profit, humanitarian aid fund)
* Communities of artists or collectors
* Startups
* Web3 protocols
* Social clubs or collectives
* And more…
