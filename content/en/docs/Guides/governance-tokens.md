# Definition

A governance token is a crypto token that gives certain rights over how projects and their Treasuries are managed. Holders of the token can generally vote on proposals and submit proposals to be voted on by other governance token holders, depending on the specific governance framework.

# Common Practices

## Token Types

Governance tokens can be both fungible tokens or non-fungible tokens. They can exist on any blockchain network. A project may have more than one type of governance token or multiple tokens within a governance system.

## Token Requirements

Some projects may specify different amounts of tokens required to be held in order to vote or set forth proposals. For example, a higher number of tokens may be required to propose than to vote to ensure that proposals that are brought to quorum are being set forth by members who have enough stake in the project. This can potentially mitigate malicious or poor fidelity proposals from passing.

## Token Staking

Sometimes, tokens must be staked to be able to be used for governance. In Move, staking project tokens (Token) unlocks the ability to use them for governance (veToken).
