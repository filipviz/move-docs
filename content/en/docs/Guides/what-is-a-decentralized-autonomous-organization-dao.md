# Definition

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity without a central leadership structure. DAOs embrace a bottom-up decision-making structure, governed by a community organized around a set of rules which uses blockchain to enforce some or all of the rules.

# Details

DAOs are owned and managed by their communities. DAOs have treasuries that are accessible to members based on the DAOâ€™s governance framework.

They can vary in their levels of decentralization and autonomy. Some DAOs rely on mostly on-chain processes, including the submission of proposals, voting and the execution of treasury transactions. However, many DAOs make tradeoffs of lower levels of decentralization and autonomy for more flexibility and agility.

DAOs may be 'wrapped' or accompanied by a legal structure. If you are looking to start a DAO, it is recommended to look into applicable laws and regulations to understand how they might apply to your specific situation.
