# Definition

A governance framework, or structure, is a project’s overall model for how it makes decisions and the governance mechanisms it employs to do so. The scope of what a governance framework defines can include:

* Scope of decisions that can be made
* Decision-making powers by person, entity, or group
* Types of proposals that can be made and how they can be made
* Types of voting strategies that can be employed and any voting parameters or restrictions
* Way in which decisions are implemented or funds are moved (e.g., on-chain vs. off-chain execution)

# Details

A governance framework is critical, especially in distributed organizations like DAOs where groups of people need to collectively come to consensus on the direction of a project.

  
A governance framework sets the guidelines for how decisions can be made, but it doesn’t include the specific processes by which decisions are made. Governance frameworks are followed by governance processes that outline specifically how project members use the governance framework to come to decisions, as well as how those decisions are executed.
