# Definition

A multi-signature wallet is a means to store digital assets more securely than a traditional crypto wallet because it uses a unique digital signature that requires more than one private key to sign transactions.

# Details

Multi-sigs are used when multiple parties need to share assets or keep assets more secure since any funds that are sent need to be confirmed by more than one person (i.e. signer) holding a private key (i.e., access to the wallet).

The configurations of multi-sig wallets can vary to include a number of parameters around the number of total signers there are and how many of those signers are needed to sign a transaction (e.g., 5 total signers with 3 of 5 needed to sign).

  
Treasuries often include one or more multi-signature wallets, of which the signers are responsible for the final execution of decisions, depending on the configuration of the multi-sig.
